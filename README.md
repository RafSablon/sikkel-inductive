# sikkel-inductive
Expansion of the Sikkel model to include inductive types. 


These modules only work with the Sikkel library and the Agda standard library installed. See [the Sikkel library GitHub page](https://github.com/JorisCeulemans/sikkel/releases/tag/v1.0) for more instructions on how to install the Sikkel library and other needed libraries.
